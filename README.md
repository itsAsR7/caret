# Welcome to CARET

The Cyber Analytic Repository Exploration Tool (CARET) is a proof-of-concept graphical user interface designed to connect the groups and techniques highlighted in [ATT&CK](https://attack.mitre.org)Â® to the analytics, data model, and sensors highlighted in MITRE's [Cyber Analytics Repository](https://car.mitre.org) (CAR).
CARET is used to develop an understanding of defensive capabilities and to aid in their development and use. 
Additional information explaining CARET and the types of questions it helps solve can be found at <https://mitre.github.io/unfetter/about>.
